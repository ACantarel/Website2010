Good Bye Germany!
=================

It's time to say good bye, again...
----------------------------------

After moving to Berlin/Germany in October 2009 for doing the VFX-work of Roland Emmerich's movie "Anonymous", I'm moving back to Los Angeles tomorrow the 19th of March. Time passed by so fast, can't believe that it's almost 18 months now since then. One one hand I think I'm going to miss Berlin, of course not the damn cold weather for sure, more that everything is close together, easy to reach and my friends. On the other hand I can't wait for the warmer temperatures in LA, the beach, the palm trees and meeting good friends over there :)
