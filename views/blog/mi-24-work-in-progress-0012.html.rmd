MI-24 Work in Progress
======================

Almost finished the wing
------------------------

After quite a while I finally found some time to continue working on it. I picked the wing as I see it as a kind of stand alone asset. 95% of it is done, just minor details are still missing and a few parts have UVs already. I hope soon I can start to slap some textures on it :)
