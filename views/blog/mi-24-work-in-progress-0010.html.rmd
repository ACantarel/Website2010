MI-24 Work in Progress
======================

Texture Shoot
-------------

After so many days of bad weather (sunshine is bad for texture shooting) we finally got the good weather! The sky was very even cloudy, almost like a white skylight in a 3d package. It took about five hours to take all the photos we needed and in the end we felt like ice cubes.

There's going to be a documentation about this texture shoot soon where all the details like type of lenses, taking multi exposure photos and the process of tone mapping are explained.

Me in the cold. There is actually another Mi-24 on the right so the cameras do point into the right direction :)
