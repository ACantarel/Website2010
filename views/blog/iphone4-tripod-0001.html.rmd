DIY Iphone 4 Tripod
======================

Made a quick DIY tripod for my Iphone 4
---------------------------------------

I like to do time lapse videos with the phone but I wasn't able to find a tripod so I bought a small Gorillapod (20 Euros), a case (10 Euros) and simply glued them together, done.
There's also a quick release plate on the Gorillapod which makes it fitting quite well into the pocket of my jacket.
