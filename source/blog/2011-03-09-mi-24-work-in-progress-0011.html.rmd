MI-24 Work in Progress
======================

First test of a tone-mapped texture
-----------------------------------

After tone-mapping a bunch of texture of the texture shoot, I made a first test. There are no other maps than the diffuse yet so for now I just threw it into the bump and reflection channel as well. The long mount for the rockets is just duplicated atm.

A piece of the wing.
