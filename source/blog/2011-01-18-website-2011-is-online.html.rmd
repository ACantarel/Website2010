Website 2011 is online, finally!
================================

Facelift done!
--------------

![Blog 0001 Website2011 01](/images/blog/blog-0001_website2011_01.jpg)

After five years of bad usability, finally my website got a facelift! A little bit of coding here, some Botox there and the help of my friend Nico Hagenburger, the new website is online!
And as it is 2011 now, which is the future, there's also all the highly fancy stuff like Twitter/Facebook buttons and this blog. Yes a blog, never thought I'm going to be part of this but after several years of everyone talking about it, I came to the conclusion it might be actually a good way to show some work in progress related stuff, interesting snapshots I took with one of my 3000 cameras or maybe even useful industry news.
I hope you enjoy it!
