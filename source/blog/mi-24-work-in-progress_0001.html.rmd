MI-24 Work in Progress
======================

Started with a new helicopter
-----------------------------

The first work in progress pictures of my new personal project I'm trying to do in my little spare time: Mi-24
It's the famous russian helicopter which is unique in it's design.
I started with the canopy which seems to be the most tricky part of the entire helicopter. So many weird shapes, everything is kind of a-symmetrical. Getting my head around it took quite some research time.
