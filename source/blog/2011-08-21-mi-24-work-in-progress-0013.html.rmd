MI-24 Work in Progress
======================

Finally some updates!
---------------------

It's been a long time since the last update, so here's the current state. Worked a lot on the wing's 8K 16bit texture and started the tail rotor which I'm unwrapping right now.
There's only the diffuse texture so far which I used for bump and reflection to do this test render. Obviously the correct maps will follow and then I can start a proper shading. There are also still some seams in the texture.
