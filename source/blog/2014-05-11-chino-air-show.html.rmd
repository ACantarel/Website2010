Chino Air Show
==============

My girlfriend Catalina and I had an amazing day at the air show in Chino, CA!
Not that I got plenty of nice aviation related photos, my girl in her 1940s outfit got plenty of visitors to turn their heads and take photos of her by themselves.

Here's a small selection of the 32GB of photos I shot that day.
